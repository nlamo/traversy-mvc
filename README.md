# traversy-mvc
Code for a PHP OOP/MVC course taught by Brad Traversy.

Purpose of this is strictly as a basis for improving my knowledge of PHP. I may modify it (and add to it) in the future if I choose to use PHP consistently, but most modern stacks don't use PHP and so it's less likely.

But in terms of my education, it's quite useful. It keeps me thinking in MVC-terms, even as it becomes increasingly likely that I shift my focus toward the component-based (React) front-end paradigm.
